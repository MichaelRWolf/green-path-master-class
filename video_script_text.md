# Video Script Texts

## Formatting Guidelines

- Each script should have proper paragraph breaks
- The outro "I'm Michael Wolf - software developer, software trainer, team coach." should start a new paragraph
- The call to action "If you want to improve..." should start a new paragraph
- This creates better readability and natural speaking pauses

## Technical Coaches Scripts

### Script - Technical Coaches (20 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about curriculum design. I used to assume the technical value would speak for itself. Now I know even developers need emotional hooks to engage with learning.

### Script - Technical Coaches (60 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about balancing knowledge and practice. I was designing technology-centric courses, assuming the value would be obvious. The Green Path showed me I needed to be student-centric. Now I assess whether students need knowledge or practice, and meet them where they actually are.

### Script - Technical Coaches (90 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about applying engineering skills to curriculum design. I used to design training like I design software - big design up front, predicting what everyone would need. But that rarely stuck. The Green Path taught me to break down learning problems, find bottlenecks, and use rapid iteration with real feedback. Now I create "Change that Sticks" - small, customized training that actually gets absorbed and adopted.

## L&D Directors Scripts

### Script - L&D Directors (20 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about bridging expertise and student needs. As a technical trainer, I was great at doing the work but struggled to design learning experiences that actually worked. The Green Path showed me how to bridge that gap.

### Script - L&D Directors (60 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about meeting students where they are. I was a technical trainer stuck between knowing my subject matter and understanding how to structure learning experiences. The mapping wasn't direct enough. The Green Path taught me curriculum design skills so I could create learning paths that actually connect with where students are.

### Script - L&D Directors (90 seconds)

I just participated in a master class for "The Green Path", lead by Marian Hartman. It shifted how I think about providing hooks to move folks from inaction to action. I used to think being a good technical trainer just meant knowing my stuff and having facilitation skills. Then I realized I was an expert at doing the work, but not at designing the structure of how to teach it. The Green Path showed me how to develop my curriculum design capabilities so I could create effective learning experiences that bridge the gap between my expertise and student needs.
