# Summary

Content - World class!

Cohort - World class!
- Marian leading.
- Arlo fluid dance between co-leader and participant.  
- Emily Bache - A joy to watch how she engaged new material (even in a new realm) and "made it her own".
- Others - A great sounding board for ideas of deep thinkers and doers.

Experienced watching world class "trainers" take the "student" role. I quoted the roles because they relate to how we used to teach/learn, and this was experiential learning that transcended the pedantry of pedagogy/andragogy. It was learning as a team activity. But then... you already know what that is. That's what we are exploring in our mobbing. This master class was not a class. It was not a workshop. It was not a training. It was not certification. Or CEU's. Or credits or degrees.

Big take-aways (thanks for asking... since it just ended it's a good time to reflect):
- The "Green Path" is a way to make "Change That Sticks", a distillation of decades' of Marian's instructional design background (flavored by a bit of software development genius).
- First, find "keystone behaviors".  If it doesn't create a ripple, it isn't a keystone behavior.  Keep looking.
- Good hooks -- I often overlook the need for an emotional hook before launching into the change.  Different contexts require different hooks - metaphor, story, relational diagram, complex diagram.
- Good recipes -- At "Simple Robot" level, the recipes must involve ZERO executive function.  If the practitioner needs to make a decision, it's too complicated/complex.
- Assessments - Heuristics to know when to (or not to) shift.
- Shift right (along practice axis) - Do it again and again.  Get it in your fingers.
- Shift up (along knowledge axis) - See Blooms Taxonomy.  Get deeper understanding of practice.
- Green Path is about blending both axes.  Too much knowledge and you get know-it-alls.  Pundits.  Pedants.  Too much practice and you get stasis.  Stuck.
