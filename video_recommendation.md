# Video Recommendation

## Goal

Provide a 20-30 second video that Marian can use to market her material.

## Background

I participated in a master class.  The Green Path is the culmination of decades of her work in cirriculum development and course development.  Built on top of her PhD.  Simple concept: walk a balance line between learning and doing.  Learn too much and you have fragile skills and are in danger of becoming a know-it-all wonk.  Do too much and you risk plateauing skills without improving, stuck in a loop doing the same thing over and over.

The master class was masterfully done.  It would have beeen much too easy for her to teach a new skill using old techniques.  She wanted to make the media (the master class) be the message (i.e. the green path).  As an insructor, I often observe other instructors to improve my own craft.  In this master class, I took (at least) two perspectives: participant and observer.  As participant, I got a lot of knowledge and practice.  As an observer, I saw how difficult it is to break out of the dominant paradigm to actually create learning that is different from previous models.

Previous models include Blooms Taxonomy and other contemporaneous bodies of knowledge that are approximately 100 years old.  While being old does not make it bad, we have learned a lot more about how we learn in the intervening century.  While Bloom's Taxonomy is descriptive or diagnostic, it does not provide direction for how to advance along the levels.

## Marian's target markets

### Technical coaches

Like me, their typical career path is rooted in technical expertise.  We are SME's.  Subject matter experts in the domain.  We know how to DO the work, and have learned a few skills on how to PRESENT the work (maybe at conferences or lunch-and-learn), but we have not studied how to TEACH the skills or the structure of creating a learning path for individuals or teams.  Marian has done that cirriculum design work, but not the software development or software training.

I have often thought that successful technical training needed two foundations: technical expertise and training expertise.  I later came to realize that any good course material (and I've experienced lots of HORRIBLE training material in my career) also required cirriculum design expertise.

This balance, this complement, of skills is well reflected in the partnership Marian has with Arlo.  Marian has decades' of experience designing training. Arlo has decades' of experience doing software development.  The skills complement each other.

Arlo was also a participant in the master class.  He also stepped into the role of co-presenter, co-teacher, co-facilitator on occasion.

Seeds for script:
- Are you a technical coach or trainer who knows how to design great software, but haven't invested similar time in learning how to design great courses or great course material?  I was...

## Style

I am a professional software developer and professional trainer/coach to software developers.  Use language the shows this and that will connect with people like me.

Be personal.  This is about my personal experience in the course.  Speak in "I phrases", not about some remote thing.

## Personal Insights from Master Class

### Key Realization: Emotional Hooks for Technical Learning
Being technical, I got caught in the trap of thinking that people would get engaged solely on the technical merits of the course or course material. During master class, I came to realize that everyone (even techies) need an emotional "hook" (as The Green Path refers to it as) to get them to commit to the work of learning. Even technical decisions are based on emotions. We are, after all, humans before we are engineers.

### AHA Moment: Tailored Hooks for Different States
AHA! Not all hooks are created equal. They must be tailored to the "objections" (as sales folks would call it). Are they set in their ways? Confused? Overwhelmed? Each current state requires a different kind of hook.

### Personal Problem: Technology-Centric vs Student-Centric Training
In retrospect, I realized my training was technology centric. It needed to be more student centric. It was as though the technology's value should be "self evident" based solely on its own merits. Even as I attempted to be in the world of the student, I realized that I could become more so. I now know how to assess when students need more knowledge and when they need more practice. And how to adapt the material to meet them where they are, not just as some pile of thingys to get them to where they should be (my assumption), or where they would like to be (more in line with THEIR objectives).

### Key Outcomes: Engineering Skills Applied to Course Design
Hammer/nail. I guess that since I'm an engineer, I still see course design as an engineering problem to be solved. But at least I see how to apply my engineering skills to this different domain - software versus courseware. But, the good part is that many of the skills I have embraced over the years are critically important: breaking large problems down into smaller (and even smaller) problems, recognizing critical paths and bottlenecks (to learning), rapid iterations with real-world feedback. Even more than I already believed, my current learning/teaching practices are about engaging folks where they are, being present with them, and supporting them by providing a safe, engaging, challenging environment for them to learn in. NOT by doing a BDUF (big design up front) prediction-in-a-vacuum of what I think they will need. It is about sensing and responding instead of anticipating. Gone are the days of pre-thinking and pre-designing a 5-day course in anticipation of mass market adoption. Here are the days of massively customized training. The former was a big brain dump that rarely succeeded. The later is (and only time/practice will tell) at least has the possibility of being absorbed and adopted. The former is big and grand, and unlikely to stick. The later is small and possible. It was designed to be "Change that Sticks."

### Script Approach
First person (Option A). I will be recording these for her to add into her marketing material.

## Messaging Focus

**Focus on training, not software.** This course is about getting better at designing training material, not about designing better software. It could get confusing because most of the training I deliver is about improving software skills. But this video needs to focus on improving training skills and on improving course/curriculum design skills. For all courses (some of which are related to software).

## Outputs

For each target market, create scripts that are 10, 20, and 30 seconds eacy.  Update sub-sections to contain the text.

### Script - Technical Coaches (10 seconds)

**"I used to think great training content would sell itself. Then I learned that even techies need emotional hooks to commit to learning. The Green Path showed me how to balance learning and doing in my course design - and my students actually started advancing instead of plateauing."**

### Script - Technical Coaches (20 seconds)

**"I was stuck designing technology-centric courses, thinking the training value should be self-evident. Then I realized I needed to be more student-centric in my curriculum design. The Green Path taught me to assess when students need knowledge versus practice, and how to meet them where they are - not where I think they should be."**

### Script - Technical Coaches (30 seconds)

**"I used to design training courses like I design software - big design up front, predicting what everyone would need. But that rarely stuck. The Green Path showed me how to apply my engineering skills to curriculum design: breaking down learning problems, finding bottlenecks, rapid iteration with real feedback. Now I create 'Change that Sticks' - small, customized training that actually gets absorbed and adopted."**
